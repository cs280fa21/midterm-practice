For optimal viewing in GradeScope, we ask you to keep the lines to 70
characters long. This paragraph is an example showcasing this
practice.
It is not required that each line is exactly 70 characters long. In
particular, do not break words to meet this specification. It is
sufficient to use this paragraph as a reference. When you reach
roughly 70 characters, hit enter to go to the next line and continue
